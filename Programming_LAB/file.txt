State and national disaster relief teams were dispatched immediately to conduct rescue operations but were hindered by strong river currents and heavy rains. The Indian Army sent more than 200 personnel to the area to assist with search and rescue operations. Local hospitals treated over 518 including more than 273 wounded people; more than 4000 people were rescued and over 10000 people were sent to 93 disaster relief camps in Wayanad.[18][2][19][20] Schools and colleges were closed in 10 of 14 districts.[8][21] Kerala's State Disaster Management Authority, Kerala Fire & Rescue Services, and Kerala police, along with the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy, Defence Security Corps (DSC), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and volunteers participated in rescue operations.

On 30 July, inclement weather with heavy rains and landslides hampered the rescue efforts. According to NDRF commander Akhilesh Kumar, rescue operations were paused during the night due to heavy rains and the threat of further landslides in the area. Six hundred NDRF teams were deployed in addition to over fifty teams from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard to take part in the relief operations.[22][23]

On 31 July, about 1500 personnel of the Armed Forces were deployed to the area. A command-and-control center was set up in Kozhikode by the Army to coordinate humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts. Navy river crossing teams had also been dispatched.[24]

On 1 August, a temporary 190-foot-long (58 m) Bailey bridge was constructed by the 144 army-men from the Army's Engineer Task Force of the Madras Engineer Group to connect the Chooralmala village with Mundakkai over the Iruvanipzha River within 31 hours.[25] The Kerala government set up 45 relief camps in the Wayanad district, accommodating over 4000 people. The state health department also established a control room for assistance in case of emergency.[19] The health minister of Kerala, Veena George, said that at least 1500 rescue personnel were deployed, including forensic surgeons.[26]

On 2 August, the Indian Air Force deployed C-130 and drone aircraft from Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad, as well as a specialized team of experts for sub soil evacuation and rescue monitoring.[27][28][29] Forty teams of rescue personnel were divided over six zones consisting of Attamala and Aaranmala; Mundakkai; Punjirimattam; Vellarmala Village Road; GVHSS Vellarmala; and downstream of the Chaliyar River. Eight police stations along the Chaliyar River were also involved in the rescue efforts with regional expert swimmers.[30] During the rescue operation in the Mundakkai village, advanced radars detected signs of breathing under the soil, however, in the evening it was determined it is more likely to be that of animals rather than trapped humans.[31]

The rescue operations resumed on 3 August for the fifth day by 07:00. Advanced radar equipment and dog squads were used to detect buried victims. As on 3 August, 341 autopsies were completed, and 148 bodies were identified.
